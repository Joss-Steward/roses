# Mission, Values, Philosophy and Vision

## Our Mission

Rose of Sharon Equestrian School is dedicated to providing equine-facilitated learning opportunities for people with disabilities in a uniquely therapeutic environment.

## Our Values

 - Dignity and respect for our students.
 - Gratitude for our volunteers and humane treatment for our horses.
 - Appreciation and empathy for our students' families and caregivers.
 - Quality programming and accessible, aesthetic environs.
 - Advocacy for equine-assisted activities and the Maryland horse industry at-large.

## Our Guiding Philosophy

Programs at ROSES are presented with compassion, hope, patience, and humility. Compassion comes from our deep desire to help, hope from believing our efforts will effect positive change; patience in waiting for that change to occur in an individual's own time; and humility as we are privileged to witness those changes manifesting in people's lives beyond the scope of the School.
Our Vision for the Future

## ROSES seeks a leadership role in the field of equine-assisted activities by:

 - Partnering with academic and medical researchers to demonstrate the efficacy of therapeutic riding programs
 - Cooperating with members of Maryland's horse industry to provide vocational training for entry-level workers
