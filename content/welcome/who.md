# Who, What, Where, Why, and How

## Who are we?

Rose of Sharon Equestrian School, Inc. is a group of dedicated people who believe that positive interactions with horses can improve the quality of life for people of all ages and abilities especially those with special needs.

## What do we do?

At ROSES, individuals with disabilities work with horses in a low risk, highly structured, authentic learning environment which encourages change, growth, and healing.

## Where are we?

ROSES is located on 12 landscaped acres surrounded by verdant farmland. The property adjoins Gunpowder State Park. Although it is situated in a rural setting, Rose of Sharon is only five miles from Interstate 695 ~ the Baltimore Beltway in Glen Arm, Maryland.

## Why do we do it?

Interaction with nature in general and horses in particular, can significantly enhance the quality of a person's life. Quality of life is directly related to health ~ physical, mental, and emotional health.

## How do we do it?

Rose of Sharon Equestrian School is a volunteer-based, non-profit organization that relies on charitable contributions, fund-raising, and minimal fees for service in order to operate. The stable is not a boarding facility. ROSES is licensed by the Maryland Horse Industry Board and complies with standards set by PATH Intl. ~ Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International.
