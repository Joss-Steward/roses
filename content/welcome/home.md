# Welcome

Rose of Sharon Equestrian School provides individuals with disabilities the opportunity to develop basic horsemanship and stable management skills in a uniquely therapeutic environment. The learning is facilitated at an accessible (ADA-compliant) stable located 20 miles north-east of Baltimore.

The facility has been designed to be a place of refuge from the challenges often encountered when living with a disability, or when caring for someone who has special needs. The thoughtful way both the programs and the grounds are being developed serves to provide everyone involved-the students, their families and caregivers, the instructors and volunteers-an environment with the restorative potential to impart a sense of peace while there and a feeling of renewed strength after leaving.
