> "As a volunteer, I have had the privilege of witnessing students of all ages and abilities experience the personal growth and enjoyment that comes from interacting with horses and nature. Each horse at ROSES exhibits amazing gentleness, patience, and obedience. Excitement, smiles, laughter, and pride in a job well done are all part of every riding lesson at ROSES."

> "My daughter's confidence has improved and I no longer hear her say, "I can't." She is proud of her abilities working with the horses and this has helped boost her self-esteem. The lessons that she has learned have carried over into her interactions with others, especially at school. This program has been a blessing to our family."

> "The unconditional love that animals can give is vitally important to the emotional well-being of a large number of my students. Many of them come from abusive and neglectful homes. The love and acceptance they receive from the horses and instructor helps in healing their bruised and broken hearts. My students always leave the farm with a sense of accomplishment."

> "While many people with disabilities see their world getting smaller and smaller, therapeutic horseback riding is a wonderful way for them to learn new skills and become stronger as a result. I have a progressive form of muscular sclerosis and there isn't much in the way of medication that can help me. I feel that my legs and back are stronger than they would have been without the training I have gotten through horseback riding. Its benefits are emotional as well as physical. I'm proud to show pictures of myself on horseback. People marvel that I can ride. So do I. Without ROSES, I would feel that a part of my life is missing."

> "I am an occupational therapist. This summer, I had the privilege of witnessing an equine-facilitated learning experience at ROSES. Both professionally and personally I was excited to see the positive change the experience with the horses affected in each student. Each student gained pride and increased self-confidence because of the things that each of them accomplished at your school."

> "I am very grateful for all that you do for our son. I see him making progress every day. He looks forward to seeing the horses and the cats every week. But most of all, he really looks forward to seeing you!!"

> "Our daughter has had hundreds of hours of therapy. Both speech and OT have been very helpful, but there was still something missing. She is very imaginative and loves animals. Just watching her connect with her horse, "Izzie" by brushing and feeding her after a pleasant morning ride at the stable, makes me realize how truly special ROSES and the volunteer staff are. This is the first activity she is excited about and truly looks forward to. She even knows what day she sees Izzie...we're very pleased."

> "I have been around horses most of my life and I have to tell you, I would rate the ROSES facility as one of the best I have ever seen. How these kids with severe disabilities responded was thrilling. The excitement on their faces, the fact that they are learning what to do with an animal three times their size and can somewhat control it was amazing. Then I looked to the parents' faces. If you could have seen the sense of pride.I have volunteered in the past with Special Olympics and other volunteer organizations and have never walked away with the feeling that I did this past weekend."

> "My son started at ROSES when he was two years old with low muscle tone, core strength, and balance. After a year his strength, endurance, and balance improved dramatically. He just turned 4 and is riding a two wheeled bicycle without training wheels!"

> "As a professional farrier for over 30 years, I have seen hundreds of riding facilities. I was immediately impressed by ROSES; first, by the obvious concern for safety. This facility was built with the welfare of the students, horses, and volunteers, utmost in mind. Next is the care of the animals. I know of no other equine operation that takes better care of its animals. And of course, the director, Joan; her ability and passion for the work with the students is quickly apparent."
