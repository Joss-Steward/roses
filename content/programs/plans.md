# Accomplishments

![Arena](arena_1.jpg "From dream to dedication")

Rose of Sharon Equestrian School has completed Phase I of it's Raise Me Up Capital Campaign to build an indoor therapeutic riding arena and classroom space! However, our efforts to fulfill the promise this building holds have just begun. For the past six years, the organization has concentrated many of its grass-roots resources on bringing this dream to fruition, believing it was key to the long-term sustainability of the program. From the smallest individual donation, to the most generous of grants, this addition to the ROSES' facility has been truly a labor of love for those directly involved with the organization as well as the community at large.

Opportunities are still available for you to have an engraved horseshoe or stirrup in honor of a loved one or a special occasion mounted on the arena wall. Options also remain for corporate citizens to name a window, the mounting ramp, the coordination center and more.

# Future Plans

Rose of Sharon Equestrian School is developing plans for the future in these areas:

 - ROSES is developing plans to build a permanent, outdoor, handicapped accessible, horse-sized labyrinth. The labyrinth will meet ADA guidelines and will preserve the existing green space. The location of the labyrinth will allow students to ride a horse in a highly motivating, low-risk setting where they can experience the sense of freedom that comes when riding in a natural environment. Please visit the Labyrinth Company.
 - ROSES is seeking ways to provide entry-level vocational training through potential partnerships with organizations like the Maryland Horse Industry Board and the Maryland State Department of Education's Division of Rehabilitative Services.
 - ROSES is developing partnerships with professionals who use the EAGALA and Natural Lifemanship models in their work to expand programs in Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy and Learning (EFP/EFL). 
 - ROSES is determined to provide equine assisted programs for Veterans and their families. Nationally, PATH International Equine Services for Heroes, and locally, Horses Healing Maryland's Military, are working to provide leadership and guidance for organizations, like ROSES, planning to offer programs designed for Veterans.
