Rose of Sharon Equestrian School currently offers programs in therapeutic horsemanship for individuals (especially children and youth) with disabilities, volunteer openings for retirees, internship and research opportunities for college students, service learning projects for middle and high schoolers, and merit badge workshops for scouts.

The School's programs address the needs of the novice and instruction is intended to develop skills in basic horsemanship and stable management. While the content of our program focuses on horses, the benefit of involvement reaches well beyond the barn. Parents and participants report positive growth in the areas of: self-confidence and social interaction, emotional and psychological well-being, physical strength and stability, as well as improvement in schoolwork and family relationships.

Developing the knowledge and skills required to be safe and effective when working with horses produces positive changes in participants' physical, mental, and emotional health. These positive changes have a direct, beneficial impact on overall quality of life. 

Special programs can be designed to meet the requirements of an individual or an organization. Our newly completed state of the art therapeutic horsemanship arena will allow more opportunities for more children with disabilities to access the benefits that can be gained in the presence of horses. No longer will lesson progress be interrupted by inclement weather or the shorter daylight hours of Fall or Winter.
