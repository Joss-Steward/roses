## Our Valued Partners

Our program horses are considered co-workers at Rose of Sharon Equestrian School. Their combination of strength, patience, and willingness to learn the nuances of the job is astonishing to witness. The care and maintenance of these special creatures is quite labor intensive and financially expensive. Visit Our Horses page to meet the ROSES equine team. Please consider sponsoring one of our special horses by using this Printable Horse Sponsorship Mail-In Form.

> For by the love that guides my pen,
> I know great horses live again.
