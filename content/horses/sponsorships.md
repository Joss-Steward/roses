## Sponsorships

Sponsorship helps ensure that our program horses remain healthy and strong for the work they do with our students. Rose of Sharon Equestrian School's volunteers contribute thousands of labor hours in the care and maintenance of these special animals, but, unfortunately, love and hard work are not enough. Feed, bedding, veterinary care, farrier services, and equipment are ongoing expenses. In order to keep program fees affordably within reach of our students and their families, we are seeking individual and corporate citizens who are willing to help us meet these expenses. Horse sponsorships are available at five levels of support. Levels are as follows:


#### Forelocks to Fetlocks Funder- One Horse for One Year- $5,000

 - Engraved plaque on your sponsored horse's door
